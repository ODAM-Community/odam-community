## Spring

<div style="text-align:left">

With one might tug and push, conservancy engineers  
in North New Mexico  
open water gates--snow melt,  
brimming northern lakes, and streams  
gush, lunge, and hurl down Río Abajo to community fields,  
fill the dry ditches and canals, clashing  
like great banging orchestra cymbals  
against dirt. 

Plants, bushes, weeds  
uncurl, furl out along my ditch,  
ants float on islands of leaves,  
past pyramids of beer cans,  
tadpoles fuse to the water  
in swirls of brown mist,  
catfish fin beneath driftwood  
and stew the water dark brown. 

All things pull and strain. The ditch swells  
into a great marketplace, where death and life  
are exchanged.  

A pair of light blue-gray doves skim water surface,  
geese veer down, royal couriers  
flap-landing in gusty sprinkles, then  
serenely floating like white flags of peace,  
drifting in pairs, through glare and shadows,  
as crawdads, spiders, snakes and frogs  
peer from mud and weed corners.  

From each unfolding lilac leaf  
a blue-green arctic haze glimmers,  
from feathers dark winter melts,  
from eyes glide out cold deeps,  
everything bears a new light.  

The crane is breaking ice with its call,  
long-legged spider skitters  
to birth-thawing rhythms of the shore,  
as spring finally arrives,  
glistening the dead-slag of winter  
in all creatures,  
as they emit that special light  
they do.
