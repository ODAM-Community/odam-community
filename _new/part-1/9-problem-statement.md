# What problem is ODAM trying to solve? [!badge text="Part I"]

 ODAM (Operationalizing Data Analytics Methodology) is a comprehensive methodology that helps organizations build a data-driven culture and achieve measurable business outcomes by providing a framework for defining, planning, executing, and measuring data analytics initiatives. It aims to solve the problem of organizations not being able to fully leverage the potential of data analytics and make data-driven decisions. Without a clear methodology and framework, organizations may struggle to align their data analytics efforts with their strategic goals and objectives, and may not be able to maximize the value of their data assets. ODAM provides a structured approach to operationalizing data analytics, enabling organizations to mature and operationalize their data analytics capabilities, and drive business value and support decision-making across multiple departments and use cases.

## Why would an organization use ODAM?

An organization would use ODAM to mature and operationalize their data analytics capabilities to drive business value and support decision-making across multiple departments and use cases. ODAM provides a framework for defining, planning, executing, and measuring data analytics initiatives, which can help organizations align their data analytics efforts with their strategic goals and objectives, and maximize the value of their data assets. Additionally, ODAM helps organizations establish a data-driven culture and provides best practices and resources for implementing data analytics in an effective and efficient manner.

## How can ODAM save your organization money?

One of the main ways is by increasing efficiency and reducing manual workflows in security operations. By automating certain processes, such as incident investigation and response, organizations can reduce the amount of time and resources required to manage security incidents. Additionally, by implementing advanced security analytics and a risk-based alerting framework, ODAM can help organizations identify and prioritize high-risk incidents more effectively, allowing them to focus their resources on the most critical threats.

Another way ODAM can save organizations money is by reducing the risk of data breaches and other security incidents. By providing a framework for defining, planning, executing, and measuring data analytics initiatives, ODAM can help organizations mature and operationalize their data analytics capabilities, which can improve their overall security posture and reduce their risk of a data breach.

ODAM can also help organizations save money by reducing the costs associated with compliance. By providing a framework for monitoring and reporting on compliance-related activities, ODAM can help organizations demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements, which can help them avoid costly fines and penalties.

## Where does one start?!

Organizations often face complex problems and challenges that they believe could be addressed through data analytics. However, they may not know where to start. To overcome these problems, ODAM can empower organizations to take the following steps.
