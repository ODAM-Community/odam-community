# About the Author

As a cybersecurity consultant and architect with over 17 years of experience, I have a passion for helping organizations secure their lines of business, innovate using data analytics, and improve their overall security posture. My expertise spans multiple technology and functional domains, and I have a strong track record of designing, delivering, and implementing new technologies for clients in various industries, including higher education, healthcare, government, utilities, and finance.

I am a trusted advisor and client success advocate, always striving to earn exceptional feedback from stakeholders. In addition to my professional work, I am deeply committed to giving back to my community through volunteering. I am a Microsoft TEALs volunteer computer science teacher at Santa Teresa High School and a Technical Mentor in the CyberPatriots program, and I always look for ways to help mentees along the way.

My key focus areas in recent years have been K-12 and election infrastructure security, but I also enjoy working with clients in a variety of sectors. I am currently working on a groundbreaking project called ODAM (Operationalizing Data Analytics Methodology) which aims to assist organizations of all kinds with operationalizing data analytics and driving value from data.

I have an interest in the ways that systems and people interact, and am always seeking new ways to engage with an audience through marketing, branding, and experience. In addition to my professional work, I am passionate about blockchain, cryptocurrency, and NFTs, and enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest developments in these fields.

I am skilled at creating frameworks and methodologies to help organizations adopt new technologies and achieve their business goals. This includes developing strategies for cross-functional collaboration and mentoring, as well as aligning technology with business objectives in order to drive meaningful results and solve complex problems. I have a talent for working with clients to understand their unique needs and challenges, and am dedicated to delivering high-quality solutions that meet their needs and exceed their expectations.

As I continue to grow and develop in my career, my goal is to help my clients achieve success through the effective use of technology, while also staying up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in my field. I am always open to new challenges and opportunities to make a positive impact in the world of cybersecurity and in my community.
