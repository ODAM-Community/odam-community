<p>&quot;Our dilemma is that we hate change and love it at the same time; what we really want is for things to remain the same but get better.&quot;<br />
<em>— Sydney J. Harris, Journalist and Author</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#x27;s natural to have mixed feelings about change, as it can bring both opportunities and challenges. However, the desire to improve and make things better is a common and important goal for many organizations.</p>
<p><figure class="content-center">

</figure>
</p>
<p>There are many things organizations and individuals can do to make things better. The question is: what motivates organizations and you to make change, challenge the status quo, and take action? For me and many others, there is plenty of motivation when I think of what the impact of the solution will be.</p>
<p>The impact of a data analytics program is likely to depend on a number of factors, including the quality and relevance of the data, the design and layout of the dashboard or report, and the intended audience and purpose.</p>

    </h2>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p><strong>Define</strong> clear objectives and goals: It is important to define clear objectives and goals for the data analytics program, so that the team knows what they are working towards and can measure their progress. This may involve setting specific targets or milestones, such as reducing the mean time to detect (MTTD) or mean time to respond (MTTR) to threats, or improving the accuracy of threat detections.</p>
<p><strong>Identify</strong> the data sources and tools needed: In order to achieve success in the areas listed, it is important to identify the data sources and tools that will be needed to support the program. This may involve evaluating and selecting data analytics platforms, such as Splunk, as well as identifying the specific data sources that will be used to support the program.</p>
<p><strong>Develop</strong> a clear strategy and roadmap: It is important to develop a clear strategy and roadmap for the data analytics program, so that the team knows what steps need to be taken to achieve their objectives and goals. This may involve identifying the specific processes and procedures that will be followed, as well as the technologies and tools that will be used.</p>
<p><strong>Foster</strong> a culture of continuous improvement: To achieve success in the long term, it is important to foster a culture of continuous improvement within the data analytics program. This may involve regularly reviewing and analyzing the program&#x27;s performance, identifying areas for improvement, and implementing changes as needed to ensure that the program is meeting its objectives and goals.</p>
<p>These recommendations can help people who are responsible for an organization&#x27;s data analytics program to set their intention and achieve success in the areas of data collection and correlation, detection, monitoring, threat hunting, triage, investigations, and incident response.</p>
<p>What successful outcomes look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up a SOC</li>
<li>More Visibility into Endpoints</li>
<li>Reduce Risk</li>
<li>Replace Legacy tools</li>
<li>Offering Splunk as a Service</li>
<li>Maturing the SOC</li>
<li>Reducing MTTI/MTTR</li>
<li>Monitoring Services/Critical Applications/Network Monitoring</li>

    </h2>
</doc-anchor-target>
<blockquote>
<p>Begin With Evaluating Your Organization&#x27;s Capabilities</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analytics maturity refers to the level of capability, expertise, and sophistication that an organization has in using data analytics to support its mission and objectives. The structure of analytics maturity is typically understood in terms of a hierarchy or progression of increasing capabilities, with each level building on the insights and capabilities of the previous level.</p>
<p>There are many different frameworks and models that have been developed to understand and measure analytics maturity, and the specific categories and definitions may vary depending on the context and perspective. Here are a few common approaches to understanding analytics maturity.</p>
<doc-tabs>
<doc-tab v-cloak id="analytics-maturity-models">
<template #title>Analytics maturity models</template>
<p>These models typically define a set of stages or levels of analytics maturity, and may include categories such as &quot;ad hoc&quot; or &quot;reactive,&quot; &quot;repeatable,&quot; &quot;strategic,&quot; and &quot;advanced.&quot; These models typically describe the characteristics and capabilities of organizations at each stage of analytics maturity, and provide guidance on how to progress from one stage to the next.</p>
</doc-tab>
<doc-tab v-cloak id="analytics-maturity-frameworks">
<template #title>Analytics maturity frameworks</template>
<p>These frameworks typically define a set of domains or areas of focus that are important for analytics maturity, and may include categories such as data governance, data management, data analytics, and data visualization. These frameworks typically describe the key practices and capabilities that organizations need to develop in each domain in order to achieve analytics maturity.</p>
</doc-tab>
<doc-tab v-cloak id="analytics-maturity-assessments">
<template #title>Analytics maturity assessments</template>
<p>These assessments are designed to help organizations understand their current level of analytics maturity, and to identify areas for improvement. These assessments may involve self-assessment tools, interviews with key stakeholders, or other methods of gathering data and insights.</p>
</doc-tab>
</doc-tabs>
<p>Analytics maturity is an important concept that helps organizations to understand their current capabilities and strengths in using data analytics, and to identify areas for improvement and development.</p>

    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Self-service data analytics is a type of data analytics approach in which users are able to access, analyze, and visualize data without the need for specialized technical skills or assistance from IT or data analysts. In a self-service data analytics environment, users typically have access to data analytics tools and platforms that are easy to use and allow them to explore data and create reports and visualizations without the need for coding or other technical expertise.</p>
<p>Self-service data analytics is designed to enable organizations to more quickly and easily gain insights from their data, and to enable users to more easily access and analyze data to support their decision-making and problem-solving. It is often used in conjunction with other types of data analytics approaches, such as centralized data analytics or business intelligence, to provide a more flexible and scalable approach to data analytics.</p>
<p>Self-service data analytics is designed to enable organizations to more easily and effectively leverage their data assets to support their mission and objectives.</p>

<p>How ODAM Can Help Your Organization</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ODAM helps organizations reduce risk by providing a clear set of steps and guidelines for planning, implementing, and managing data analytics projects. This structured approach helps to ensure that projects are well-defined and that all necessary steps are taken to ensure their success.</p>
<p>ODAM also helps organizations reduce risk by providing guidance on how to identify and prioritize the most important business needs and objectives, and how to align data analytics efforts with those needs. This helps organizations to focus on the most important data analytics projects and avoid wasting resources on less important or less valuable projects.</p>
<p>Finally, ODAM assists organizations in reducing risk by guiding them through the process of identifying and managing potential risks and challenges that may arise during the course of a data analytics project. Identifying potential sources of risk, developing contingency plans, and monitoring and managing risk throughout the project are all part of this. Organizations can reduce risk and increase the likelihood of success for their data analytics projects by adhering to the ODAM principles.</p>

        <span>Risk as a Factor</span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>The FAIR (factor analysis of information risk) approach is a framework for understanding, analyzing, and managing cyber risk. It is based on the idea that risk should be understood and managed in a consistent and objective way, using a common language and set of principles.</p>
<p>The FAIR approach is based on five key principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Risk is a function of the likelihood of an event occurring and the impact of that event.</li>
<li>Risk should be measured in terms of loss exposure, which is the potential financial impact of a risk event.</li>
<li>Risk assessment should be based on objective and quantifiable data, rather than subjective opinions or assumptions.</li>
<li>Risk management should be an ongoing process, rather than a one-time event.</li>
<li>Risk management should be based on a consistent and repeatable process, using a common language and set of principles.</li>
</ol>
<p>The FAIR approach provides a framework for understanding and managing cyber risk in a consistent and objective way, using a common language and set of principles. This can help organizations to better understand their risks and make informed decisions about how to manage those risks.</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s the asset/thing you’re trying to protect?</li>
<li>Who is motivated to attack? Who might come after the asset? (Threat actors).</li>
<li>How would they come after the asset?</li>
<li>What’s the impact if the attacker is successful?</li>
<li>What is the scope of the risk scenario and what is the risk statement?</li>
</ul>
<p>The word <code v-pre>impact</code> means different things to different people. For instance, negative impacts to private businesses are different from those of the impacts to county governments. If a ransomware event happens in a business, the impact could be lost revenue and lost productivity. If a ransomware event happens in a county, terrible, life-threatening circumstances can arise. County’s usually operate jails and other essential services like (e)911. If a ransomware attack prevents doors from opening or phone lines to ring, people could lose their lives.</p>

<p>Over the last decade I’ve observed many ways and attempts of describing risk, priority, and worst case scenarios. In other words, there are many ways of describing risk, priorities, and what ifs. The cybersecurity field has many approaches and offerings that try to solve this problem (i.e., lack of a common language) but are still falling short.</p>
<p>How can we simplify things so that everyone with the organization can have an ample understanding of cybersecurity but more specifically, an understanding of how priorities are established. I’m a big believer in the “show your work” phrase we learned in elementary school when practicing math. Organizations should be able to quickly and easily show what pieces of technology and process are relevant to their mission and what data was used to derive findings.</p>
<p>To that end, I believe that organizations that take a methodical approach to identifying IT infrastructure (hardware and software) and processes relevant to the mission are more successful in keeping things secure, available, and free from issues. This first step - gathering a basic inventory - lays the foundation for building a resilient operation within your organization.</p>

        <span>The 3 Cs of Data Literacy</span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Jordan Morrow, a data literacy expert, identified the three Cs of data literacy: curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking. These three traits are essential for individuals to have in order to effectively work with and understand data. Morrow believes that by fostering these qualities in individuals, they are better equipped to approach data with a curious and open mind, generate creative insights, and think critically about the data they are working with.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creativity</strong> is the ability to generate original and innovative ideas, and it is an important aspect of data literacy because it allows individuals to approach data with a fresh perspective and to find new and creative ways to analyze and interpret it. By being creative with data, individuals can be more likely to uncover new insights and identify opportunities that may not be immediately apparent. Creativity can also help individuals to see data in a different light, enabling them to discover new patterns and trends and make connections that might not have been previously considered. Overall, creativity is an essential component of data literacy that helps individuals to think creatively, explore new ideas, and find novel solutions to complex data problems.</li>
<li><strong>Curiosity</strong> is a key aspect of data literacy. It drives individuals to seek out new information and to explore different data sources and perspectives. Being curious about data can help individuals to ask the right questions and to look for patterns and trends that might not be immediately obvious. This, in turn, can lead to new insights and a deeper understanding of the data.</li>
<li><strong>Critical thinking</strong> is the ability to analyze and evaluate data in a logical and systematic manner, including considering the sources, quality, and implications of the data. This skill is essential for making informed and sound decisions based on data.</li>

This approach to data analytics often involves investigating data to identify patterns and trends, and advanced techniques. For example, identifying correlations and causes or using data mining techniques to uncover hidden insights.</p>
