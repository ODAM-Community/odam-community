??? note "Building a Data-Driven Culture: The Role of Communication, Engagement, and Collaboration"
    ## Building a Data-Driven Culture: The Role of Communication, Engagement, and Collaboration 

    Effective data analytics culture in an organization is built on a foundation of strong communication, engagement, and collaboration. One key element of this is regular office hours or "ask me anything" sessions, in which team members can ask questions, seek guidance, and share insights with one another. Outreach to the broader organization, through events, community building initiatives, and other forms of engagement, can also be important for fostering a data-driven culture. Establishing a feedback loop, through which team members can share their experiences and ideas, is another key component of building a successful data analytics culture. Finally, social proof - the idea that people are more likely to adopt a certain behavior or attitude if they see others doing the same - can be a powerful force in driving the adoption of data analytics practices and tools within an organization. By focusing on these key elements, organizations can build a culture that is conducive to the effective use of data analytics to drive business decisions and outcomes.

    ??? tip "Maximizing Value and Minimizing Risk: How ODAM Can Help Your Organization"
        ### Maximizing Value and Minimizing Risk: How ODAM Can Help Your Organization

        ODAM helps organizations reduce risk by providing a clear set of steps and guidelines for planning, implementing, and managing data analytics projects. This structured approach helps to ensure that projects are well-defined and that all necessary steps are taken to ensure their success.

        ODAM also helps organizations reduce risk by providing guidance on how to identify and prioritize the most important business needs and objectives, and how to align data analytics efforts with those needs. This helps organizations to focus on the most important data analytics projects and avoid wasting resources on less important or less valuable projects.

        Finally, ODAM assists organizations in reducing risk by guiding them through the process of identifying and managing potential risks and challenges that may arise during the course of a data analytics project. Identifying potential sources of risk, developing contingency plans, and monitoring and managing risk throughout the project are all part of this. Organizations can reduce risk and increase the likelihood of success for their data analytics projects by adhering to the ODAM principles.

        ??? info "Risk as a Factor"
            #### Risk as a Factor

            The FAIR (factor analysis of information risk) approach is a framework for understanding, analyzing, and managing cyber risk. It is based on the idea that risk should be understood and managed in a consistent and objective way, using a common language and set of principles.

            The FAIR approach is based on five key principles:

            1. Risk is a function of the likelihood of an event occurring and the impact of that event.
            1. Risk should be measured in terms of loss exposure, which is the potential financial impact of a risk event.
            1. Risk assessment should be based on objective and quantifiable data, rather than subjective opinions or assumptions.
            1. Risk management should be an ongoing process, rather than a one-time event.
            1. Risk management should be based on a consistent and repeatable process, using a common language and set of principles.

            The FAIR approach provides a framework for understanding and managing cyber risk in a consistent and objective way, using a common language and set of principles. This can help organizations to better understand their risks and make informed decisions about how to manage those risks.

            - What’s the asset/thing you’re trying to protect?
            - Who is motivated to attack? Who might come after the asset? (Threat actors).
            - How would they come after the asset?
            - What’s the impact if the attacker is successful?
            - What is the scope of the risk scenario and what is the risk statement?

            The word ‘impact’ means different things to different people. For instance, negative impacts to private businesses are different from those of the impacts to county governments. If a ransomware event happens in a business, the impact could be lost revenue and lost productivity. If a ransomware event happens in a county, terrible, life-threatening circumstances can arise. County’s usually operate jails and other essential services like (e)911. If a ransomware attack prevents doors from opening or phone lines to ring, people could lose their lives.

            </figure>

            Over the last decade I’ve observed many ways and attempts of describing risk, priority, and worst case scenarios. In other words, there are many ways of describing risk, priorities, and what ifs. The cybersecurity field has many approaches and offerings that try to solve this problem (i.e., lack of a common language) but are still falling short.

            How can we simplify things so that everyone with the organization can have an ample understanding of cybersecurity but more specifically, an understanding of how priorities are established. I’m a big believer in the “show your work” phrase we learned in elementary school when practicing math. Organizations should be able to quickly and easily show what pieces of technology and process are relevant to their mission and what data was used to derive findings. 

            To that end, I believe that organizations that take a methodical approach to identifying IT infrastructure (hardware and software) and processes relevant to the mission are more successful in keeping things secure, available, and free from issues. This first step - gathering a basic inventory - lays the foundation for building a resilient operation within your organization.

    ??? tip "IT Governance Alignment"
        ### IT Governance Alignment

        When you say that your goal is to align with IT governance, it means that you want to ensure that the analytics center of excellence (ACE) aligns with IT governance policies, processes, and practices of the organization.

These three traits are essential for individuals to have in order to effectively work with and understand data. Morrow believes that by fostering these qualities in individuals, they are better equipped to approach data with a curious and open mind, generate creative insights, and think critically about the data they are working with.

            - Creativity is the ability to generate original and innovative ideas, and it is an important aspect of data literacy because it allows individuals to approach data with a fresh perspective and to find new and creative ways to analyze and interpret it. By being creative with data, individuals can be more likely to uncover new insights and identify opportunities that may not be immediately apparent. Creativity can also help individuals to see data in a different light, enabling them to discover new patterns and trends and make connections that might not have been previously considered. Overall, creativity is an essential component of data literacy that helps individuals to think creatively, explore new ideas, and find novel solutions to complex data problems.
            - Curiosity is a key aspect of data literacy. It drives individuals to seek out new information and to explore different data sources and perspectives. Being curious about data can help individuals to ask the right questions and to look for patterns and trends that might not be immediately obvious. This, in turn, can lead to new insights and a deeper understanding of the data.
            - Critical thinking is the ability to analyze and evaluate data in a logical and systematic manner, including considering the sources, quality, and implications of the data. This skill is essential for making informed and sound decisions based on data.

        ??? info "The Four Levels of Data Analytics"
            #### The Four Levels of Data Analytics

            Jordan Morrow also defined the four levels of analytics as descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive. These levels describe the increasing complexity and sophistication of data analysis, from simply describing what has happened in the past, to predicting future outcomes and prescribing actions based on those predictions. 

            - Descriptive analytics (Level 1): This level of data analytics involves summarizing and describing data, and may include activities such as generating reports, calculating totals and averages, and creating charts and graphs.
            - Diagnostic analytics: This level of data analytics involves investigating data to identify patterns and trends, and may include activities such as identifying correlations and causes, and using data mining techniques to uncover hidden insights.
            - Predictive analytics: This level of data analytics involves using data and statistical models to make predictions about future outcomes or events, and may include activities such as building predictive models, forecasting future trends, and simulating scenarios.
            - Prescriptive analytics (Level 4): This level of data analytics involves using data and analytical insights to recommend specific actions or decisions, and may include activities such as optimization, simulation, and decision-making support.
            
            These four levels of data analytics represent a hierarchy of increasing complexity and sophistication, with each level building on the insights and capabilities of the previous level.
 
            Exploratory data analytics typically refers to the process of examining data in order to discover patterns, trends, and insights that might not be immediately apparent. This process may involve using various techniques and tools to visualize and analyze data, and to identify relationships and correlations within the data.

            >SIDE BAR: Exploratory data analytics is an important aspect of data analysis, as it can help organizations to better understand their data, to identify trends and patterns that might not be immediately apparent, and to generate insights and ideas that can inform decision-making and problem-solving.

            In terms of the levels of data analytics that I described earlier, exploratory data analytics could be considered to fall under the category of diagnostic analytics. This approach to data analytics often involves investigating data to identify patterns and trends, and advanced techniques. For example, identifying correlations and causes or using data mining techniques to uncover hidden insights.

??? note "The Data-Driven Product Development Process: From MVP to Iteration"
    ## The Data-Driven Product Development Process: From MVP to Iteration

    An MVP (minimum viable product) is a product that has the minimum set of features and functionality needed to satisfy end users, and to provide a basis for learning and future development.
    
    I like to use the MVP concept to describe what the end user should expect out of the gate. It is tempting to think that every KPI and visualization a user could want is on their dashboard out of the box but as we all know, there is some assembly required.
    
    If we’ve already created an IT Service Blueprint for one of the organization’s services, we can begin to ask our personas questions about what KPIs are going to be most meaningful and important off the bat. This could be a measurement of capacity or speed. The bare bones of a dashboard are assembled to create the MVP for this persona and over the next months or quarters, it will be up to the ACE to solicit and collect feedback from the end user community. 
    
    Planning for Ask Me Anything sessions or Office Hours can be a good way to make the ACE a welcoming place.
    
    As end users come to these office hours and talk to one another as well as the ACE, they can begin to share their lessons learned and experiences with one another. This helps build and foster community and trust which ultimately creates culture.
    
    Let’s summarize some typical steps when launching an MVP:

    - Define the problem that the persona is trying to solve and determine the applicable KPIs or insights to include in the MVP.
    - Define the persona and user group. 
    - Identify key features like filtering or the ability to select from a dropdown list.
    - Design and develop the dashboard or schedule reports.
    - Create a prototype.
    - Testing and validation of the MVP.
    - Launch the MVP! Make it available to users and begin gathering data and feedback to inform future development.
    - Finally, iterate and evolve. Use the data and feedback gathered from the MVP to refine and improve the product, and to add new features and functionality over time. Don’t forget to communicate with your user community along the way! 

    The goal of launching an MVP is to quickly and efficiently test and validate a product concept, and to gather insights and feedback that can inform future development.
