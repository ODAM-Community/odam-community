# ODAM: A Data Strategy Template

??? note "Part II"
    ## Part II

    The focus should not be on a specific technique or element but rather on the broader concepts of alignment, sustainability, and resilience. 

    When it comes to creating a data strategy that incorporates focus on the broader concept of alignment as opposed to specific techniques, organizations can operationalize their tailored strategy for improved operational resilience.

    Let’s take a look at the high-level steps that organizations can take to operationalize their customized data strategy. In Part III, I will outline the essential elements and steps to set up an ACE. An ACE would deploy and operate the data strategy.

    - First, the organization must develop a clear plan of action. One of the first steps in operationalizing a proactive data strategy is to develop a clear and detailed plan of action that outlines the specific steps and tasks that need to be completed to implement the strategy. This includes identifying the resources and personnel needed, establishing timelines and milestones, and identifying any potential barriers or challenges that may need to be overcome. ODAM provides a template Program Charter for you to customize and tailor to your organization.
    - Assign clear roles and responsibilities: It is important to clearly define the roles and responsibilities of each team member or department within the organization to ensure that everyone knows their part in implementing the cybersecurity strategy. This may include establishing a clear chain of command and delegating tasks and responsibilities to appropriate team members.
    - Establish metrics and benchmarks: To measure the effectiveness of the cybersecurity strategy, it is important to establish metrics and benchmarks that can be used to track progress and identify areas for improvement. This may include metrics such as the number of successful cyber attacks, the time it takes to detect and respond to threats, and the overall cost of cybersecurity efforts. ODAM will assist organizations with the prioritization of metrics and KPIs by leveraging the IT Service Blueprint methodology.
    - Regularly review and update the strategy: As the threat landscape and the needs of the organization change, it is important to regularly review and update the cybersecurity strategy to ensure that it remains effective. This may include conducting periodic risk assessments, integrating new technologies or controls, and updating policies and procedures as needed.

    Operationalizing a tailored cybersecurity strategy blueprint requires clear planning, clear roles and responsibilities, the establishment of metrics and benchmarks, and regular review and updates to ensure that the strategy remains effective in addressing the evolving threat landscape and the needs of the organization.

    ## ODAM’s Impact on CDO, CIO, and CISO Goals

    As a CxO, there are common and shared goals.

        ![Goals of CxO](/assets/strategy-template/cxo-goals.png){ width="500" }
    </figure>

    One key way to achieve these goals is through the adoption of a comprehensive data strategy, such as ODAM. ODAM allows CIOs, CDOs, and CISOs to efficiently and effectively manage their organization's data strategy, ensuring that data is collected, processed, and used in a consistent and secure manner; which ultimately creates value. By adopting ODAM, CxOs can drive business performance, improve compliance, and promote a data-driven culture within their organization. As data becomes increasingly central to modern business operations, the role of CxOs in managing and leveraging data will only become more important.

    The ODAM (Operationalizing Data Analytics Methodology) use case lifecycle is a comprehensive process for identifying and addressing data-driven problems and opportunities. It involves twelve steps, including defining requirements, identifying data sources, designing logic, onboarding and validating data, developing a proof of concept, performing user acceptance testing, documenting operational procedures, providing training and enablement, promoting to production, and optimizing and measuring performance. Each step is designed to help organizations develop and implement effective data analytics solutions that meet the needs and expectations of their users. By following the ODAM use case lifecycle, organizations can ensure that their data analytics projects are well-planned, well-executed, and deliver value to their stakeholders.

    Here is a brief explanation of each of the top-level items in a use case life cycle strategy. Each section represents a step in the process for developing a use case for data analytics, from defining the requirements and identifying data sources, to developing and testing the use case to ensure that it meets the needs and expectations of the users.
