# Bringing Data to Life: A Practical Approach to Building an Analytics Center of Excellence

Data is a valuable resource, just like water is in arid regions like New Mexico. In the same way that farmers must carefully manage their water rights and usage through contracts and agreements, organizations must also carefully manage their data to get the most value out of it. One way to do this is by building an Analytics Center of Excellence (ACE), which can help an organization make the most of its data by providing a central hub for data analytics and visualization.

The poem "Spring" by Jimmy Santiago Baca describes the arrival of spring in North New Mexico, as water flows into the acequia and brings life to the community fields. The acequia  (ə-ˈsā-kē-ə), or network of canals, acts as a conduit for water, just as networks of data conduits can help organizations distribute insights and information to users.

In the same way that the acequia association helps to manage water rights and ensure the smooth bureaucratic flow of water to the fields, an ACE can help an organization manage data rights and ensure the smooth flow of data insights to users. The ACE can serve as a resource for answering questions and addressing issues related to data analytics.
