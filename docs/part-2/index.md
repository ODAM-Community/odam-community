## Intro

The focus should not be on a specific technique or element but rather on the broader concepts of alignment, sustainability, and resilience. 

When it comes to creating a data strategy that incorporates focus on the broader concept of alignment as opposed to specific techniques, organizations can operationalize their tailored strategy for improved operational resilience.

Let’s take a look at the high-level steps that organizations can take to operationalize their customized data strategy. In Part III, I will outline the essential elements and steps to set up an ACE. An ACE would deploy and operate the data strategy.

First, the organization must develop a clear plan of action. One of the first steps in operationalizing a proactive data strategy is to develop a clear and detailed plan of action that outlines the specific steps and tasks that need to be completed to implement the strategy. This includes identifying the resources and personnel needed, establishing timelines and milestones, and identifying any potential barriers or challenges that may need to be overcome. ODAM provides a template Program Charter for you to customize and tailor to your organization.

Next, it is important to clearly define the roles and responsibilities of each team member or department within the organization to ensure that everyone knows their part in implementing the cybersecurity strategy. This means establishing a clear chain of command and delegating tasks and responsibilities to appropriate team members.

When it comes to measuring the effectiveness of the cybersecurity strategy, it is important to establish metrics and benchmarks that can be used to track progress and identify areas for improvement. This may include metrics such as the number of successful cyber attacks, the time it takes to detect and respond to threats, and the overall cost of cybersecurity efforts. ODAM will assist organizations with the prioritization of metrics and KPIs by leveraging the IT Service Blueprint methodology.

Also, be sure to regularly review and update the strategy. As the threat landscape and the needs of the organization change, it is important to regularly review and update the cybersecurity strategy to ensure that it remains effective. Organizations can conduct periodic risk assessments, integrate new technologies or controls, and update policies and procedures as needed.

Operationalizing a tailored cybersecurity strategy blueprint requires clear planning, clear roles and responsibilities, the establishment of metrics and benchmarks, and regular review and updates to ensure that the strategy remains effective in addressing the evolving threat landscape and the needs of the organization.
