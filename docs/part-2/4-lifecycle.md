The ODAM (Operationalizing Data Analytics Methodology) use case lifecycle is a comprehensive process for identifying and addressing data-driven problems and opportunities. It involves twelve steps, including defining requirements, identifying data sources, designing logic, onboarding and validating data, developing a proof of concept, performing user acceptance testing, documenting operational procedures, providing training and enablement, promoting to production, and optimizing and measuring performance. Each step is designed to help organizations develop and implement effective data analytics solutions that meet the needs and expectations of their users. By following the ODAM use case lifecycle, organizations can ensure that their data analytics projects are well-planned, well-executed, and deliver value to their stakeholders.

Here is a brief explanation of each of the top-level items in a use case life cycle strategy. Each section represents a step in the process for developing a use case for data analytics, from defining the requirements and identifying data sources, to developing and testing the use case to ensure that it meets the needs and expectations of the users.
