One key way to achieve these goals is through the adoption of a comprehensive data strategy, such as ODAM. ODAM allows CIOs, CDOs, and CISOs to efficiently and effectively manage their organization's data strategy, ensuring that data is collected, processed, and used in a consistent and secure manner; which ultimately creates value. By adopting ODAM, CxOs can drive business performance, improve compliance, and promote a data-driven culture within their organization. As data becomes increasingly central to modern business operations, the role of CxOs in managing and leveraging data will only become more important.
