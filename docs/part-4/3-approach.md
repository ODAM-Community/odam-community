Splunk's phased approach to security maturity is a systematic framework that helps organizations to progressively improve their security posture over time. The approach is designed to help organizations to quickly detect, investigate, and respond to threats.

1. Ad-hoc search and investigation capabilities **(Level 1)**.
2. Proactive Monitoring and Alerting **(Level 2)**.
3. Security Situational Awareness **(Level 3)**.
4. Real-time Risk Insight and Automation **(Level 4)**.

One of the key benefits of ODAM is its ability to increase visibility into security logs and enable organizations to monitor their security posture in real-time. This can help organizations identify potential security threats more quickly and respond to them more effectively. Additionally, ODAM can provide advanced security analytics and a risk-based alerting framework, which can help organizations proactively identify and respond to security incidents.

ODAM can also help organizations integrate threat intelligence into their security operations. By incorporating threat intelligence into their data analytics initiatives, organizations can enhance their overall security posture and stay ahead of potential threats.

One of the most exciting ways that ODAM can help organizations is by preparing for new capabilities like Splunk Mission Control. Splunk Mission Control is an innovative platform that unifies security operations and enables organizations to improve their incident response times, automate their workflows, and gain real-time visibility into their security posture.

By using ODAM to mature and operationalize your data analytics capabilities, organizations can be better prepared to take advantage of new technologies like Splunk Mission Control. This can help improve threat detection, investigation, and response capabilities, and ultimately become more resilient against security threats.
