## Continuous Monitoring for Cybersecurity

> Threat Intelligence, Incident Handling, Forensics, and Self-Assessment

> "Not everything that can be counted counts and not everything that counts can be counted."
> _â€” Albert Einstein, Physicist_
        
The focus should not be on a specific data source or technology but rather on the broader concept of observability.

IT operations refer to the activities and processes involved in maintaining and managing the technology infrastructure, systems, and applications of an organization. This can include tasks such as installing and configuring hardware and software, monitoring systems and networks for issues or outages, and troubleshooting and resolving problems as they arise.

IT observability, on the other hand, refers to the ability to monitor, measure, and understand the performance and behavior of IT systems, networks, and applications. This can include collecting and analyzing data from various sources, such as log files, performance metrics, and traffic patterns, to identify trends, issues, and potential problems.

The main difference between IT operations and IT observability is that IT operations focus on the day-to-day management and maintenance of IT systems, while IT observability focuses on understanding and optimizing the performance and behavior of these systems. Both are important for ensuring the smooth and reliable operation of an organization's technology infrastructure, but they serve different purposes and use different approaches and tools.

Threat intelligence, incident handling, forensics, and self-assessment can all be important factors in a continuous monitoring approach to cybersecurity.

==- Threat intelligence
Threat intelligence refers to information about potential threats or vulnerabilities that an organization may face, such as new malware strains or zero-day exploits. This information can be used to inform continuous monitoring efforts by helping to identify potential risks and vulnerabilities, and to prioritize the most important areas to focus on.
==- Incident handling
Incident handling refers to the process of responding to and managing security incidents or breaches, such as malware infections or unauthorized access to sensitive data. This can be an important part of continuous monitoring because it helps to identify and address potential issues as they arise, and to prevent further damage or loss.
==- Forensics
Forensics refers to the process of collecting, analyzing, and preserving digital evidence for the purpose of investigating security incidents or crimes. This can be an important part of continuous monitoring because it helps to identify the root causes of incidents or breaches, and to understand the extent of the damage or loss.
==- Self-assessment
Self-assessment refers to the process of evaluating an organization's security posture and identifying areas for improvement. This can be an important part of continuous monitoring because it helps to identify weaknesses or vulnerabilities that may not be immediately apparent, and to take steps to address them.
