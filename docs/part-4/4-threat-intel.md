# The Role of Threat Intelligence in Cybersecurity Maturity [!badge text="Part IV"]

Threat intelligence is essential in a phased approach to achieving cybersecurity maturity. It enables organizations to understand the various types of threats they may encounter and the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that attackers use. This information helps organizations to develop a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy that addresses their specific threats and vulnerabilities.

During the planning phase, threat intelligence is used to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities and prioritize the most pressing risks. This information is then used to inform the development of a risk assessment and risk management plan.

In the implementation phase, threat intelligence helps organizations to select and deploy appropriate cybersecurity controls or technologies.

During the ongoing maintenance phase, threat intelligence is used to continuously monitor for and assess new threats and vulnerabilities, and to update the organization's cybersecurity strategy and controls as needed.

In summary, threat intelligence is a crucial factor in a phased approach to achieving cybersecurity maturity, as it provides organizations with the information they need to identify and prioritize threats, and to implement and maintain a robust and effective cybersecurity strategy.
