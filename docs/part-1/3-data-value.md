# Understanding the Hierarchy of Data Value [!badge text="Part I"]

When it comes to data, not all data are created equal. In fact, there are different tiers of value when it comes to data, each serving a specific purpose.

- **Tier 1** data is considered the _**most valuable**_, as it is used frequently and requires quick access. This type of data is typically stored on high-speed storage systems for efficient searching.
- **Tier 2** data is accessed less frequently, and therefore is stored on different storage systems. It may not require the same level of speed as Tier 1 data, but it is still considered important to the organization.
- **Tier 3** data is considered the _**least valuable**_, but it is still important for compliance purposes such as eDiscovery. This type of data is stored long-term, but is not accessed as frequently as the other tiers.

The value of data can be determined by a number of factors, including search frequency, performance, capabilities, classification, compliance, governance, and location. For example, firewall logs may be important for cybersecurity and IT operations, but not necessarily for the desktop support team.

By understanding the hierarchy of data value, organizations can better align their IT infrastructure and contextualize their data for the appropriate audience. Using the IT Service Blueprint method, organizations can map out the technology used to provide IT services to specific populations of users. This helps to ensure that the right data is being collected, stored, and accessed in the most efficient and effective way possible.
