ODAM (Operationalizing Data Analytics Methodology) is a methodology that helps organizations bring data analytics to the next level. Not only can it provide an efficient way to define, plan, execute, and measure data analytics initiatives, but it also can play a critical role in an organization's cybersecurity. By following this methodology, organizations can use data analytics to improve their threat detection capabilities, streamline incident investigation and make faster and more informed decisions in their incident response efforts. This can lead to more efficient and effective cybersecurity operations, help organizations stay ahead of emerging threats, and ultimately minimize the impact of security incidents on the organization and its stakeholders.

Through ODAM, you will be able to mature and operationalize its data analytics capabilities, enabling it to drive business value and support decision-making across multiple departments and use cases.
